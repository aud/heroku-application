    <h1>In summary</h1>
    <p>
      I started out at Shopify in the Guru role, and transitioned to the Tier 2 team a little while after. In May of this year, I joined Tier 3 where the majority of development work I did was in support of improving services/internal. Primarily writing code in Ruby, as well as admin facing bug fixes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in these three different roles at Shopify gave me the unique skill set to collaborate with both technical, and non technical people on a day-to-day basis. This gave me the perspective to see the kinds of toil and technical problems facing our support department, and the tooling we need to improve it. This has allowed me to see how merchant’s challenges can be translated into a development perspective. A big part of Shopify for me is positive merchant communication. The tools our support team uses is critical to this process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, I’m confident that I can contribute at a high level to the team, and have the technical ability, alongside the willingness to learn. The impact  learning, troubleshooting, and investigating  root problems of a bug is very important to me. The scaling of infrastructure and application design for the long-term is essential for building lasting tools. Thank you for the consideration and opportunity to work alongside the Support Operations Development Team, and building on the future of Shopify.
